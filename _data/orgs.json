    "description": "The 3D Toolkit is a collection of programs that allow working with 3D point cloud data. The tools include a powerful and efficient 3D point cloud viewer called \"show\" which is able to open point clouds containing millions of points even on older graphics cards while still providing high frame rates. It provides bindings for ROS, the Robotic Operating System and for Python, the programming language. Most of the functionality of 3DTK is provided in the form of \"tools\", hence the name which are executed on the command line. These tools are able to carry out operations like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), plane detection, transformations, surface normal computation, feature detection and extraction, collision detection and dynamic object removal. We support Linux, Windows and MacOS. 3DTK contains the implementation of several complex algorithms like multiple SLAM and ICP implementations as well as several data structures like k-d trees, octrees, sphere quadtrees and voxel grids. The software is home of the implementation of algorithms from several high impact research papers. While the Point Cloud Library (PCL) might be dead, 3DTK is alive and actively maintained by an international team of skilled researchers from all over the world, ranging from Europe to China. Know-how from 3DTK influenced several businesses from car manufacturers to mineral excavation or archaeological projects.",

The server management is done through a friendly user interface (the \"platform”). The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.\n\nThe installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.\n\nOnce the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users. Some applications are Plugins (developed as an RoR \"engine\") and some are very popular open source apps and services.",

Show you have a definite plan with dates and deliverables split into weeks.\n* __Get in contact ASAP!__: We get a lot of proposals: some good, most bad. Get in contact with your potential mentor '''as soon as possible''' by sending your proposal to the mailing list, and asking for feedback. Be responsive to feedback. Refine your application based on feedback. If the mentors remember you, your chances of being picked are higher. \n* __Read the Ideas Page!__: If you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read [[Ideas for Google Summer of Code|the ideas page]]. Read the ideas page.\n* __Do the coding challenge__: Every idea will have a coding challenge to perform, this is basically a test to see if you have the required skills to do the project or if you can acquire them in a short amount of time.",

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.\n\nOver the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).\n\n# Features\n\nappleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.\n\nappleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage), RGB and spectral rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.\n\nAlong with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max and Blender. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engine’s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).",

The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.\n\n# More than just code\nWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.",

In particular, what led you to your current area of study?\n* Why are you applying to the GSoC? In particular, why are you applying to the BeeWare Project?\n* If you could build any cross-platform application (mobile, desktop or both) - what would you build?\n\nWe will blind review these initial applications to develop a short list of interesting applicants. We will invite those on the shortlist to complete a video interview. We will invite some interviewees to complete a short project, and develop a full project proposal. We will assess the process of working with you on this small project, and the quality of your project proposal, and use that as the basis for our slot request to the GSoC program.\n\nIt will be in your interest to start this application process early. If you submit your initial application hours before the GSoC application deadline, we won't have enough time to evaluate you fully.",

    "description": "The Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University was founded to explore cyberspace, share in its study, and help pioneer its development. We represent a network of faculty, students, fellows, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and virtual architects working to identify and engage with the challenges and opportunities of cyberspace.\n\nWe investigate the real and possible boundaries in cyberspace between open and closed systems of code, of commerce, of governance, and of education, and the relationship of law to each. We do this through active rather than passive research, believing that the best way to understand cyberspace is to actually build out into it.\n\nOur faculty, fellows, students, and affiliates engage with a wide spectrum of Net issues, including governance, privacy, intellectual property, antitrust, content control, and electronic commerce. Our diverse research interests cohere in a common understanding of the Internet as a social and political space where constraints upon inhabitants are determined not only through the traditional application of law, but, more subtly, through technical architecture (\"code\").\n\nAs part of our active research mission, we build, use, and freely share open software platforms for free online lectures and discussions. We also sponsor gatherings, ranging from informal lunches to international conferences, that bring together members of our diverse network of participants to swap insights – and sometimes barbs – as they stake out their respective visions for what the Net can become. We also teach, seeking out online and global opportunities, as well as supporting the traditional Harvard Law School curriculum, often in conjunction with other Harvard schools and MIT.\n\nRead more about the Berkman Klein Center at our homepage.",

To reach this destination, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networks. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.\n\nThe XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.\n\nPranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:\n\n“Working in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees. This experience has helped me develop my overall profile. As a GSoC organization, I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you, XIA team!”",

    "description": "The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.",

However, we're doing lots of other things that are related, including tinkering with open video hardware (JokerTV), imaging (OCR), and more. So we have projects that cover a range of interests, despite our core tool being the most amazing subtitle extractor.\n\nAnd now, the official description: Whether it's because you are learning a new language, have hearing problems or just at a loud place, subtitles are an essential part of enjoying TV and movies for a a lot of people. There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but when it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. If you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

    "description": "We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = \"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.  We welcome your contribution!\n\nPlease see our [ideas list](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2018-ideas.html) for [how to get started](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2018-ideas.html#get-started).",

Indicate you're interested in an existing project idea or that you have one of your own, or even that you just are interested in CiviCRM but none of the projects are quite right. \n\nPeople in the channel will help you create a good match between your interests and what would be a do-able project. This process will normally be a back and forth, with a project getting refined and changed from the original idea. We want to help you create as good a proposal as possible! \n\nWe may reach out into the community to find experts in the area of your interest, or user organizations with an interest in your proposal. At some point we'll likely have you setup a gitlab account (https://lab.civicrm.org/community-team/gsoc2018/blob/master/gitlab-new-account.md)  and create an issue that will be a space where the project will be defined in more detail (see https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

    "description": "We develop the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) because we believe it is revolutionizing the study of the ancient world. It is doing so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).\n\nDue to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars discover the commonalities of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version-controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre-trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models), we provide easy-to-use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.",

Most work needs to be written in Python or JavaScript, of which an intermediate-level knowledge is expected. For all projects, we ask that you carefully read and follow the our [GSoC proposal template](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/GSoC-proposal-template).\n\nFor a project focused on a Classical language, it is a requirement that you have an intermediate-level knowledge of that language. If you do not know much about NLP, that is fine, the mentors can work with you on this. If you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See [the docs](http://docs.cltk.org/en/latest) for an idea of what functionalities we have for various languages. \n\nFor those not familiar with an ancient language, we would like to see a web project that builds off the work (both in JavaScript) of two previous GSoC students. In 2016, a text reading environment was created. In 2017, a text-serving backend and annotation framework, both specifically build to handle the diverse conventions of pre-modern texts, were added to this reading environment. For 2018, we would like to see the work of the previous summers turned into fully abstracted and added as libraries into the npm registry. See the Project ideas page for full technical details.\n\nIf you are unsure of how to contribute, please reach out to us on Gitter or Google Groups.",

The (2) psycholinguistics group studies the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on (3) the computational linguistics group.\n\nCurrent research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.\n\nOver the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.",

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.\n  \nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is an AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to set up infrastructure, resolve dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to the latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers, and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allows researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing, and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe, Tensorflow and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an open source web platform that aims to help researchers, students and data scientists create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits, and different evaluation metrics. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking AI, we want to circumvent many of the factors impeding the rate of progress in AI.",

    "description": "coala: Language Independent Code Analysis\n\ncoala provides a common command-line interface for linting and fixing all your code, regardless of the programming languages you use. It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n# For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n# For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n# For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.",

Our recent web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell. Over the last couple of years, Cell Collective has also made its way into classrooms, where students in life sciences courses can learn about biological processes by building, simulating, breaking, and re-building computational models of these processes. Cell Collective now supports about 2,000 students/year in introductory life sciences courses in 10+ universities.\n\nOther technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.\n\nOur group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.",

    "description": "After four years of development the Android Jabber/XMPP client is mostly feature complete for now. However an instant messaging client in a federated ecosystem like Jabber is only as good as the rest of the ecosystem. The ecosystem needs good desktop clients, it needs good servers and good providers who maintain their servers and keep them up to date with the latest features. Conversations.im as an umbrella organization is about bringing improvements to that ecosystem. Partially by improving existing clients and servers but also by creating tools that aid server administrators to maintain their servers and that aid end users to pick a good, stable provider. Those tools include the XMPP Compliance Tester or the XMPP uptime monitor. We have a [collection of ideas](https://conversations.im/gsoc.html) that we think will improve the end user experience, but we are also very open to hearing other ideas that we didn’t think of ourself. Have you always thought about creating a service that will look up phone numbers and return Jabber IDs or otherwise improve the discoverable of contacts? Great. Let us hear your ideas and we might be able to find a suitable mentor for you. Want to add a new feature to an existing client? Great we will put you in touch with the appropriate mentors. Want to start developing your own client? Probably not a very good idea since every platform already has a client that awaits your help.",

You can submit any project proposal that you believe will bring value to the XMPP ecosystem. Be it tools that help server admins create better servers, add a specific feature to a specific XMPP server or client or tools that somehow improve the usability for end users.

    "description": "The DBpedia project is aiming to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\n\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\n\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That's the kind of query we are talking about.\n\nWe are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.",

All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.\n* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.\n* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.\n\nAlthough Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. \n\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\n\nDebian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\n\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.",

    "description": "Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.\n\nIt's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.\n\nThe Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.\n\nThe Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.\n\nDrupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.",

Good knowledge of the C programming language or assembler and a basic understanding of the git revision control system are required.\n\nWe expect students to pass a qualification task to get accepted. Passing this task will prove that you know how to program in C (or assembler), that you can handle git and - most importantly - that you are able to communicate with us on the mailing list and understand our sometimes complex review process.\n\nTherefore, it is important to get in touch with us as early as possible. Your qualification task is object to the very same review process like every other patch. Usually, many iterations are needed to make a patch acceptable which will take time.\n\n# Apply\n\nBest to prepare your proposal is to get to know our community and communication channels. Subscribe to our development mailing list and join #ffmpeg-devel on the freenode IRC network. You will already be able to gain a lot of insight about us, our rules and procedures by just following discussions on these channels.\n\nNext, write your potential mentor an initial mail to actually dive into your application. Be elaborative about yourself and your interest in the project so that your mentor can adapt to your capabilities in the best possible way. Your mentor will then guide you through your qualification task and possibly through all the rest of a successful Summer of Code.\n\n[Find all details in our Wiki](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/GSoC/2018)",

A user can upload individual files or entire software packages. Fossology will unpack this upload if necessary and run a chosen set of agents on every file of the upload. An agent can implement any analysis operation on a text file. The FOSSology package as of now focuses on license relevant data. However, it could be extended with analyses for different purposes (e.g. static code analysis).\n\nFOSSology lets users generate licensing documentation according to the organization's needs, in a variety of data formats, emphasizing SPDX tag-value and RDF documents.

It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.\n\nOur goal is to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their ecosystem. Such hardware designs can for example be single \"IP blocks\" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website [LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org).\n\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\n\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a few ideas, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.\n\nGoogle Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference [ORConf](https://orconf.org) with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Gdansk, Poland, on September 21-23.",

Free UK Genealogy provides free access to historical data of interest to family historians and others. Over twenty years, thousands of volunteers have so far transcribed over 400 million records. The databases, search engines and user interfaces have largely largely designed and maintained by volunteers, who have been supported by a number of contractors and, more recently, a small team of support staff.  FreeREG uses mongodb, Ruby on Rails, and Refinery CMS.  FreeCEN is transitioning from mysql to mongodb, from php to Ruby on Rails, and does not have a CMS in its old interface (www.freecen.org.uk).  \n\nFor FreeREG, we are planning to use the summer to finish work on Version 1.5 Coordinator Enhancement - these are features which allow our volunteer coordinators to support the transcribers in their teams, and to monitor and maintain the quality of the transcription work.  We hope to have finished the tasks relating to the development of new communications systems (but there may be some bug fixing to do) and be working on improvements suggested by the coordinators. \n\nFor FreeCEN, we are also  planning to use the summer to work on features for Coordinators - but this is at an earlier level.  Using our learning from FreeREG, we need to enable Coordinators to move on from outdated (and unstable) software for quality control, and undertake this using online tools. We are also beginning to explore how to offer the same functionality as www.freecen.org.uk (lots of ways to search!) on freecen2.freecen.org.uk - perhaps using AI.",

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began 25 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.  This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.",

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.",

    "description": "Ensembl was created alongside the publication of the first draft of the human genome in 2001 to distribute this goldmine of information to scientists across the world. It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.",

These collaborations are often based on industry trends that require collaborative development of solutions for increased functionality in automobiles.  GENIVI has become a community where ecosystems outside of the automotive industry can meet and leverage the global automaker and supplier network in the GENIVI membership.\n\nGENIVI is accelerating innovation within the automotive ecosystem and driving initiatives founded on leading trends including system on a chip (SOC) consolidation, advanced user interfaces, software-over-the-air (SOTA), car-to-cloud connectivity and entertainment in autonomous vehicles. \n\nAn example of automotive trends meeting open technology is the GENIVI Vehicle Domain Interaction Strategy. GENIVI, in collaboration with other global technology providers, is developing open standard interfaces and code that bridge multiple car software domains. \n\nGENIVI has also delivered multiple software components that have been adopted and deployed in production vehicles worldwide.  Developed by GENIVI, several standard interfaces (APIs) have been adopted in many commercial and open source solutions.  These software components and interfaces are combined into a buildable baseline (based on Yocto Project’s meta-ivi layer) as well.  This baseline is the basis of the GENIVI Development Platform (GDP) that is an open source, automotive development platform where prototypes and innovative IVI and connected vehicle solutions can be rapidly developed and tested.",

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).",

    "description": "GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\n\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\n\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python programming language, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.",

Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, tool kit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.\n\nWhat’s so good about Haiku anyway?\n==\n\nThe key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:\n\nSpecific focus on personal computing\nCustom kernel designed for responsiveness\nFully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs\nRich object-oriented API for faster development\nDatabase-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata\nUnified, cohesive interface\n\nWhy Haiku?\n==\n\nThe Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.\n\nWho is behind Haiku?\n==\n\nHaiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.",

It has a strong, static type system with Hindley-Milner type inference.\n\nThe language natively supports lazy evaluation, and functions are generally not allowed to have side effects. This leads to a concise and declarative style of programming, which differs quite a bit from conventional languages. By not allowing side effects and dealing with immutable data, the compiler can avoid whole classes of bugs.\n\nHaskell generally compiles to fast, native code, but it can also be compiled to other targets like JavaScript (through GHCJS) or LLVM.\n\nIn Google Summer of Code, we attempt to improve not only the language, but the whole ecosystem. This includes (aside from the language itself):\n\n- Compilers\n- Commonly used libraries\n- Commonly used applications written in Haskell\n- Profilers, debuggers and other tools\n- Package managers and infrastructure\n\nWe have compiled an ideas list together with long-time Haskell users, compiler contributors and researchers, and as such we believe these are important projects for the industry and academia both.",

    "precis": "This project aims at interfacing two C++ libraries for medical simulation in order to aim at highly realistic modeling of the human body",
    "description": "__Description of the code__\n[SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) is an open-source framework for multi-physics simulation and is being developed for more than 10 years. Today, SOFA benefits from a large international community made up of research centers and companies. The SOFA core has a LGPL license (permissive and non-contaminating) fostering development of prototypes and products under any commercial license. Among the fields of application, SOFA is commonly used for:\n- soft and rigid body dynamics,\n- heat transfer,\n- robotics\n- and visualization.\n\n![Modeling with SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SectionLiver-s.png)\n\n__1. Coupling SOFA + Pulse__\nThe objective of this project is to create an open-source plugin for SOFA building an interface with the open-source library [Pulse](http://physiology.kitware.com/) platform. This engine provides comprehensive models for the human physiology. Both API are very close to each other: C++, Cmake, a core library with optional plugins. The integration will be helped with two mentors: one from the SOFA community and another one from the Pulse community.This project will therefore bring a new open-source technology to drive medical research, and innovation.\n\n__2. Emscriptening Sofa__\nWe now would like to be able to execute SOFA in the browser to promote the development of simulation based web-based applications. As SOFA a implemented in C++ this is not straightforward. This project aims at adapting the core of the SOFA simulation framework so that it can be compiled with Emscripten. Emscripten is a compiler that takes C/C++ code and compiles it to efficient subsets of JavaScript as asm.js and webassembly. \n\n__3. Communication protocols in SOFA__\nThe purpose of this project is to improve the communication plugin by adding more protocols in it such as vrpn, serial bus communication, and also improve the way it works. This plugin has an abstract base to run and implement different protocols asynchronously to the main sofa-framework thread. In a near future it has to be the default base for communicating with SOFA. \n\n__Contact__\n[Hugo Talbot, coordinator for SOFA at the Inria Foundation](https://www.sofa-framework.org/consortium/contact/)",

The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parameterizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.",

    "description": "# What is InterMine?\nInterMine integrates data from different biological sources, providing a web-based user interface for querying and analysing the data. Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our [client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries).\n## What technologies do we use? \nInterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.\n## What sort of data does InterMine have? \nSince InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. \n## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?\nGenomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.",

If you've written code, share it with us. A uni coding assignment is a good example of your work even if you don't have anything else. \n- Try to upload your code to GitHub (or a similar repository) if you can.

General knowledge of DHCP, IPv6 and network operations in general are extremely helpful for these projects.  \n\nKea is written in C++11. The Kea project uses Google test, Google benchmarks, provides a REST interface and can use a number of DB backends: MySQL, Postgres, and Cassandra.  Experience with these technologies will give you a head start on the project. \n\nIf you join this project, you will learn how to create professional-quality code: we do rigorous code reviews, require unit tests, written requirements and user and developer documentation.",

It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent\nsoftware. It is written in C++, Python and JavaScript, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE\ncommunication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.\n\nReal robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.\n\nGetting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor\nor the actuator devices. Those local functions build the Hardware Abstraction Layer API. The robotic application gets the sensor readings and orders the actuator commands using such HAL to unfold its behavior.\n\nJdeRobot include many tools: (a) JdeRobot-Academy, a suite for teaching robotics and computer vision, with 20 motivating exercises; (b) VisualStates, for visual creation of automata that control robot behavior; (c) Scratch2JdeRobot, for programming advanced robots with a full visual language; (d) robot teleoperators, even with web technologies; (e) a tuner for color filters, etc.",

By contributing to JGraphT, you'll be powering the projects of many academic researchers and industry developers now and in the future, and gaining real-world development experience for yourself.\n\n# What's Involved\n\nMost of the projects on our ideas list are algorithm implementations or improvements.  After ramping up on general familiarity with JGraphT, carrying out a project typically involves \n\n* reading relevant research papers\n* studying existing portions of our codebase\n* discussing approaches with mentors and the rest of the community\n* developing and testing an implementation in your own github branch\n* submitting a pull request for review\n* responding to code review comments\n* over and over until...\n* your pull request gets merged into trunk and eventually released!\n* and then you get your first bug report :)\n\nFor larger projects, the work may need to be broken up into a series of pull requests.",

At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.\n\nJitsi Desktop (previously SIP Communicator) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP,  Bonjour, etc. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, macOS, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others. \nThe Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects such as \nice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (http://ice4j.org)\nlibjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (https://jitsi.org/libjitsi)\nJitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (https://jitsi.org/videobridge)\nJitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (https://jitsi.org/meet)\nTogether with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.\nThe development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions.

Kiwix runs on most platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux) and is, of course, free to use.\n\nThe software passed the million direct downloads mark at the end of 2016, 80% of these users being in the Global South. Kiwix is also used by a host of organizations around the world, be it in rural schools of Western and Southern Africa or education and rehabilitation programs in US and European prisons. There are also uses we hadn't planned for: Kiwix is for instance [distributed by the Cuban government](https://www.ecured.cu/EcuMóvil) to help people save on data costs, or by NGOs in North Korea trying to [smuggle uncensored information](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/north-korea/) into the hermit kingdom. \n\nWe have recently started releasing \"custom apps\"; that is, Android apps that are based on the Kiwix engine but offer only a specific piece of content. A good example is WikiMed, an application that offers medical content from Wikipedia in 10 languages: again, it is particularly popular in the Global South (India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Iraq and Egypt, but to name a few of our larger user bases).",

For example, what could be wrong about \"Thursday, 27 June 2017\"? Well, 27 June 2017 was not on a Thursday, and LanguageTool detects that.\n\nLanguageTool supports more than 20 languages (to a different degree), including English, Russian, German, Polish, Spanish, and French.\n\n### How\n\nInternally, LanguageTool uses four different approaches to find errors:\n* it scans for known error pattern with a pattern languages similar to regular expressions, but more powerful\n* it uses Java code to find errors that are too complex for the error-pattern approach\n* it uses statistics to find uncommon sequences of words\n* it uses artificial intelligence to see if commonly confused words are used properly (like ad/add or cease/seize)\n\n### The Future\n\nArtificial intelligence will be the main approach in the future to detect text errors. We're looking for your help and ideas to apply AI to the proofreading problem, for example by using a seq2seq approach like in machine translation.\n\nLanguageTool is also an end user application, and users want LanguageTool to be integrated in the software they already use. We're looking for integrations into tinyMCE, CKEditor, and many others (your suggestions are welcome). Plus, the existing browser add-on for Firefox and Chrome needs major UI improvements.",

    "description": "LEAP is a dedicated to giving all internet users access to secure communication. Our focus is on adapting encryption technology to make it easy to use and widely available. We want to make it possible for any service provider to easily deploy secure services, and for people to use these services without needing to learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open, federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the user’s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible.\n\nOn the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a “provider in a box” set of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.\n\nThe LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary. Because the LEAP system is based on open, federated protocols, the user is able to change providers at will, preventing provider dependency and lock-in.",

    "description": "LibreOffice is a modern Free & Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

Provide detailed informations on the project you want to work on and the use cases. The more precise your description is, the more it will show us that you investigated the area and though about it properly before submitting. The best is to base your project on one of our Ideas that come complete with friendly mentors to help you. You may have some nice project ideas, but make sure that someone will be able to mentor your project and knows that part of the code well enough.\n\nProblems that can not be resolved on our public developer mailing list or problems containing privacy relevant topics can also be sent to our [mentoring@documentfoundation.org](mailto:mentoring@documentfoundation.org) address.",

LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.",

The secret to its success is its _embeddability_: Lua is a tiny portable core than can be adapted to any project.\n\nThe flip-side to this is that Lua itself does not come with many libraries, it features only the bare minimum. Enter LuaRocks: by using it to  install additional packages called \"rocks\", LuaRocks turbo-charges Lua, making it a suitable language for any field.\n\n# The package repository\n\nIn the [luarocks.org](http://luarocks.org) repository one can find packages for all sorts of areas. LuaRocks also allows third-party projects to host their own package repositories (either in [luarocks.org](http://luarocks.org) or in their own servers), so that LuaRocks can work as the plugin manager to their project.\n\n# The build system\n\nLuaRocks also doubles as a portable build system for compiling Lua modules.

    "description": "### What is Matrix?\nMatrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.\n\n[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.\n\n### What is Matrix’s Mission?\nMatrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\n\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\n\n### What does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\n\n### How is Matrix currently being used?\n[Lots of different clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to existing services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with Gitter or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!\n\nRecent work on Matrix includes [E2E encryption](https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/) (see FOSDEM 2017 talks below), [embeddable widgets](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/08/23/introducing-matrix-widgets/), [Communities](https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e) and [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite)!\n\n* [Encrypting Matrix](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/)\n* [The future of decentralised communication](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/)",

Students may also wish to hang out in #matrix:matrix.org or #matrix-dev:matrix.org to better understand the project.\n\nA good next starting point is to play with the Matrix API to send and perhaps receive some instant messages - or experiment with some of the more unusual Matrix clients which are currently in development.  Another good bet would be to try installing a Matrix homeserver (e.g. https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) to get a feeling for the technology involved.\n\nWe then suggest thoroughly reading through our [GSoC Ideas List](https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md) and asking questions on #gsoc:matrix.org about the items which interest you.  The ideas are intended for inspiration - almost all of our GSoC projects to date have been influenced but not dictated by the ideas list. **Please note that the final 6 items on the list are included primarily as 'food for thought'**.  Having run your ideas past the chatroom for feedback, we recommend writing a 3-5 page proposal in Google Docs to flesh it out more fully.  You are welcome to ask the team for guidance on the proposal as you write it.\n\nFor more details on how to write the proposal itself, please see https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/README.md.",

Include diagrams to help us understand your proposal. If you propose anything that requires a database schema you need to show us the proposed schema. The same applies to UI changes/additions -- we need to see mock-ups. If you provide no mock-ups, schemas or supporting diagrams, you won't be accepted.\n\nAs part of applying for SoC we require that you take your idea and propose it to the MusicBrainz developer community. Please propose the idea and then respond to any  questions that may arise. Improve your proposal based on the feedback you receive from the community. If you cannot  get the community to support your idea your chances for getting your proposal accepted are very slim. Finally, in order to have your GSoC application be accepted by MetaBrainz you MUST interact with your potential mentor and submit one bug fix or new feature that is related to your proposal. You will need to create a schedule of how you plan to spend your time. A weekly breakdown with a few milestones is best.\n\nDo you have Github , Twitter or any other public profiles you think we might find interesting?\nHave you contributed to other Open Source projects or created projects on your own time? If so, which projects and can we see some of your code?\nDo you plan to have a job or study during the summer in conjunction with Summer of Code?",

The framework is written in the Ruby programming language and includes components written in C, many flavors of Assembly, Python, Powershell, PHP, and other languages.\n\nThe framework consists of tools, libraries, modules, and user interfaces. The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.",

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n# Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.",

Users of ODK software include Red Cross, World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control, Jane Goodall Institute, Gates Foundation, the Carter Center, and many others.\n\nThe ODK ecosystem has several tools that are used to collect data. For GSoC, we will focus on the popular Android form filling client ([ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect)), the desktop downloader ([ODK Briefcase](https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase)), and a Android-based data collection hub ([ODK Services](https://github.com/opendatakit/services)).\n\n** Examples of ODK projects are below. Contribute and make the world a better place! **\n\n* Hutan Aceh in Indonesia is home to tigers, elephants, orangutans, and rhinos. EIA International and local activists protect it by documenting forest crimes with ODK. The geo-tagged forms, rich with photos, provide the evidence needed to save habitat. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/109241884).\n* Evaluating global health programs involves collecting, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data. Population Council, Marie Stopes Uganda, and Gobee Group use ODK to streamline the process. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/38123850).\n* The Jane Goodall Institute uses ODK to empower local communities to better manage and monitor their forests. ODK lets these communities connect directly with the global carbon marketplace and demonstrate the concrete benefits of their efforts to protect the forest. [Watch video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CNXv8EEs0P8). \n* The Carter Center uses ODK to get the real-time data needed to assess elections. Over the last six years, ODK has been used to monitor elections in Liberia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Nepal, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, and Tunisia. [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-CGzo3m4PA).\n* For governments working to end polio, access to accurate and timely information makes a world of difference. ODK is used in Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and South Sudan as a key tool in mass polio vaccination campaign quality control. [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zROyvrvt-zk).",

    "description": "### Introduction\nThe Roberta Initiative “Learning with Robots” was started more than 15 years ago by Fraunhofer IAIS in Germany with the objective to get kids interested in technology and science by constructing and programming robotic kits. The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.\n\n### The lab\nThe Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to programming robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <https://lab.open-roberta.org/> is online and has had more than 100.000+ visits in 2017 across 135 countries.\n\nThe backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the form of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 7 different robot plugins:\n* EV3 LEGO Mindstorms \n* NXT LEGO Mindstorms\n* BBC micro:bit \n* Calliope mini\n* Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based\n* NAO, a humanoide robot\n* Bob3\n\n### Outlook\nWhile the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.",

The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;\n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.\n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;\n- And [more](http://openastronomy.org/members/)!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.",

    "description": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\n\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such.  This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.",

    "description": "# Why Oppia?\nOppia’s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor. For an example, see: https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. \n\n# Community-driven lesson creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.\n\n# Come join us!\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!",

    "description": "# Why PEcAn? #\nClimate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change. Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.\n\n\n # How does PEcAn do that? #\n\nPEcAn consists of **1)** state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, **2)** a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and **3)** a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. \n\n# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # \n\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\n\n# High functionality and performance #\n\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.",

These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.\n\nPCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows.  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:\n\n###### PCP Collectors\nThese are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.\n\n###### PCP Monitors\nThese are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.\n\nThe PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.\n\nClient applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.",

Our global community of contributors ensures that end-users receive a stable, secure, and infinitely customizable product that's easy to deploy and maintain while also being fun and simple to use.\n\n## Why choose phpBB?\nOriginally released in 2000, the latest version of the phpBB software has evolved to include an extensive permissions system, user groups,  hierarchical subforums, file attachments, intuitive notifications, OAuth authentication, support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server), and a variety of other features. The phpBB Customization Database of styles and extensions offers administrators endless ability to adapt the software to their needs.\n\nOur strict security practices have resulted in a hardened product with a proven track record greatly exceeding that of our commercial competitors. Likewise, our coding guidelines and collaborative development model ensure that code quality is a top priority while encouraging constant developer learning and growth.\n\n## phpBB and Google Summer of Code\nWe are proud to have participated in the GSoC program during four prior years. The goal of our mentors is to ensure that all students have a smooth and fulfilling experience. Former phpBB GSoC students have flown across the world to meet the rest of our team during our annual hackathon and have gone on to become long-term contributors to the project, some even joining the core development team. We hope that you will help us continue this excellent trend.",

We're here to assist and happy to walk you through the process.\n\n## Proposal writing tips\nThese are suggestions based on what we have seen work in the past. Of course, there could be many reasons why they do not apply to your particular case, and that is perfectly okay. You can always ask us for help if you have any doubts.\n\nWe have found that good proposals are generally 1-4 pages long, and contains the following sections:\n\n**Introduction**: A few lines about you, your studies, and your qualifications to implement the specific idea. \n\n**Features and design**: This is the most important part of your proposal. You should outline what you would like to implement, and how it integrates with the phpBB software. You do not need to specify all implementation details, however (e.g.: if you need some data that is expensive to generate, it is important that you mention the need to cache the sorted data, however you don't need to specify the sorting mechanism).\n\n**Timeline**: Your project should be broken down into tasks with specific milestones. We generally like timelines broken down by individual weeks. \n\nIf in doubt, just ask us. We're excited to be working with you!",

For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.\n\n# Programming Languages\nInitially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 8 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.\n\n# Copy-Paste-Detector\nAdditionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in all the above languages and additionally in C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, and Swift.\n\n# Usage\nPMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.\n\n# Extensibility\nPMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.\n\nAn innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.",

    "description": "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, macOS, Solaris), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.\n\nAn enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate. There are active PostgreSQL instances in production environments that manage many terabytes of data, as well as clusters managing petabytes. Some general PostgreSQL limits are included in the table below.",

The status gets updated each time the pull request title is changed.\n\n# How does Probot work?\n\nProbot is a Node.js framework based on the [Express Server framework](http://expressjs.com/). It provides APIs to subscribe to events that are happening on GitHub to run your custom code. For example, the `WIP GitHub App` mentioned above is built with Probot in only about 20 lines of code: https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot/tree/master\n\n# Why apply for Probot?\n\nYou will create your very own GitHub application, your own product that you can add to your portfolio at the end of the summer. While working on your own app, you will interact with the Probot core team and learn how to contribute to the core project itself.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you :)",

Specifically, the software addresses the problem of doing this efficiently and reliably on general purpose operating systems like OSX, Windows, Debian, etc.-- i.e., systems designed mainly for multi-tasking.\n\nPurr Data builds on code from several other software projects: Pure Data-- which is the audio and scripting engine, Pd-extended-- which is a now abandoned application that shipped Pure Data with lots of external libraries, and Pd-l2ork-- which added long-needed usability enhancements like infinite-undo and native state-saving mechanisms to Pure Data.\n\nPurr Data uses a GUI based on the nw.js toolkit.

    "description": "# What is Quill.org?\nQuill.org is an education technology nonprofit that helps over 750,000 learners around the world improve their writing and critical thinking skills through innovative technological approaches. We're grateful to have support from organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google.org, and AT&T Foundation.\n\n# Improving Education with Innovative Technology\nQuill was recently featured in [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers) and the [Google Machine Learning blog](https://blog.google/topics/machine-learning/quillorg-better-writing-machine-learning/) for our work applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to helping learners become better writers and critical thinkers. We leverage this technology alongside a proven curriculum of learning techniques from top educational researchers. \n\nLearners begin by completing a [diagnostic activity](https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic) that provides the learning management system enough information to predict where the student is strong and where they need improvement. Then, teachers can assign follow up activities that provide practice targeted specifically to where the student is falling short. (There are even [special versions of the diagnostic](https://medium.com/writing-with-quill/quill-org-launches-ell-diagnostic-ac2dd65de692) for English language learners whose first languages are Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Hindi.)\n\nQuill has a variety of activity types, including [a real-time classroom lessons mode](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons), [a sentence construction tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect), [a proofreading practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader) and [a grammar practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar).\n\nEach tool has associated algorithms for assessing and providing targeted feedback in response to student submissions. These algorithms utilize rules-based logic, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\n# What's Next?\n\nUp until now, Quill has primarily been built as a tool for educators to use with their students. This means that Quill does not currently have a self-study mode for learners who are not in a classroom setting. We're excited for the GSoC community to help leverage Quill's progress so far into a learning tool that can assist millions of learners around the world who deserve better education.",

It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

You can also choose any of the GitHub issues if they are big enough to be a qualification task, still small enough to be finished in no more than a couple of weeks.\n\nSteps for the application process\n\n  - Read Google's instructions for participating\n  - Grab any project from the [list of ideas](http://radare.org/gsoc/2018/ideas.html) that you're interested in (or propose your own)\n  - Write a first draft proposal using Google Docs and [our template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDPGgr_D5tQuYLQi_gEGlkuQ-DlU8GH5kDBqZbVSC7I/edit?usp=sharing) and ask one of the mentors or administrators to review it with you\n  - Submit it using Google's web interface\n\nHow to fill in the application template\n\n  - Keep it simple enough to fit on no more than a couple of pages. Despite the shortness of the sentences, try to preserve the clarity of the proposal.\n  - Try to split the GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. \n - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.\n - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.\n - Submit your proposal early, not at the last minute\n - You can also choose a “backup” idea (the second task you probably want to do), so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.",

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations, and also junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis. \n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nFor GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.\n\nOur server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.\n\nThe server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a \"modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism\" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.\n\nRocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.  \n\nChat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.  Rocket.Chat supports the chat bot and ML, conversational bots, and voicebot communities  - with adapters for new bot framework – including the bBot super-bot-framework.",

It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.\n\nRails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.\n\nThe Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:\n\nDon't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.\n\nConvention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.",

Statsample and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while daru, nyaplot and gnuplotrb take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was awarded the [Ruby Association Grant in 2014](https://goo.gl/usseDY), Rubex and tensorflow.rb [received it in 2016](https://goo.gl/QNiMq9) and RbCUDA in [2017](http://www.ruby.or.jp/en/news/20171206).\n\nWorking on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz.

By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.\n\nThe mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.\n\nPython is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations.

    "description": "# A Scalable language\nScala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. It’s reinvigorated the team.”",

    "description": "Since 2014, ScummVM acts as a GSoC umbrella for game preservation projects, such as its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\nScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. Recently we have also started adding engines for RPG games.\n\nResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.\n\n- ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.",

While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX.\n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability. This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable. HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale.

Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any data.\n* The Sugar Journal records everything you do: It is a place to reflect upon and evaluate your work.\n* Sugar runs on most computer hardware, including slower machines.\n* Sugar is Free (Libre) Software: It is written in the Python language and easily customized.\n* Sugar is documented by its users: It is easy to use and teachers worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.\n* Sugar is largely written and maintained by its users.\n* Sugarizer is a fork of Sugar available for tablets and phones.\n* Turtle Blocks and Music Blocks are popular programming Apps that run in Sugar, Sugarizer, or stand-alone on the GNU/Linux desktop or in a browser.",

Transparency is a relatively easy concept to understand: the work that we do is done in a manner that can be observed by anybody with an interest. While many open source organizations regard openness as a synonym for transparency, the Eclipse community defines openness as a project team being open to new ideas, and inviting others to participate. Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called \"level playing field\").\n\nNaturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code. With over [three hundred](https://projects.eclipse.org/) open source projects covering a diverse set of of technologies, there's something here for everybody. \n\nEclipse projects build technology in areas such as [Internet of Things](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/internet-things), [Programming Languages and IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/language), and [Runtimes](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/runtime) like Jetty and [EE4J](http://www.eclipse.org/ee4j) (currently known as Java EE).\n\nFor those students interested in research, we have an entire working group focused on [Science](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science) where researches from some of the world's most prestigious labs do open source development to support their research areas.\n\nYou've probably heard about our market-leading software development tools; we have that, and so much more...",

    "description": "Founded in 1999, The Honeynet Project is an international, non-profit (501c3) research organization dedicated to improving the security of the Internet at no cost to the public.\n\nOur achievements are based on the principles of open source and volunteer efforts, with all software or papers created being licensed as open source and made freely available to the community.\n\nWe help coordinate the development, deployment, advancement and research findings of honeypot and anti-malware related technologies. With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.\n\nSimply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:\n\nAwareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\n\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.",

Our projects cover a wide range of programming languages and technologies. Project idea difficulty can range from fairly challenging, low level systems type projects that are likely to appeal to pretty confident programmers, through interesting data analysis, to data presentation projects building more effective user interfaces. We are always interested in discussing a student's own project ideas, and actively aim to mentor high quality student ideas too. If you are unsure, we can help you form your ideas during the student proposal submission period. If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list.Then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please don’t be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ). If you prefer email, check out the link to our mailing list or use project@honeynet.org. We are looking forwards to hearing from you and hopefully collaborating on something awesome together this summer.",

    "precis": "JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine which is written in Java, and is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from model checkers to test case generators.",
    "description": "The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2018 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University , University of Minnesota, Stellenbosch University - ZA, Charles University - CZ, Teesside University - UK, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, there exists many different extensions of JPF that capture different functionalities, including verification, testing, debugging, program repair and security analysis.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.",

Note that not all projects require a deep understanding of Java or JPF. Please look at the project descriptions to determine which skills are most important.\n\nJPF is a software verification tool. It is a customizable virtual machine that enables the development of various verification algorithms. It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects not being familiar with formal methods is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.\n\nYou can find some project ideas on our [project ideas](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2018-Project-Ideas) page. Please note that this list is not exclusive. If you are interested in a project that is not listed here, and it is relevant to JPF, we would love to hear about it. You can either email it to us or share your idea in our mailing list. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding JPF and the GSoC program do not hesitate to email us. Join our IRC channel #jpf on freenode to engage in a discussion about JPF.\n\nIn order to apply to our organization, you need to submit a proposal to Google during the student application phase (03/12 - 03/27).

    "description": "Are you interested in contributing to a widely-used performance evaluation tool for computer networking research? [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) is a *discrete-event, packet-level network simulator* with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the [Overview/Statistics page](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/)), but in summary, we have a users mailing list ([Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users)) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.",

    "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries / add-ons for Processing, Processing for\nAndroid, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).\n \nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit.

That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.\n\nSimplify complex log data\n\nEven if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.\n\nDatabases destinations\n\nIf you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, even Oracle!), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis, if that's what you are after.\n\nMessage queue support\n\nsyslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.\n\nSupport language bindings\n\nWant to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.",

    "description": "Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.\nThe goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.\nThis goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams.  On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis.  With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. \nTools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.",

    "description": "TLA stands for the Temporal Logic of Actions, but it has become a shorthand for referring to the TLA+ specification language and the PlusCal algorithm language, together with their associated tools.\n\nTLA+ is based on the idea that the best way to describe things formally is with simple mathematics, and that a specification language should contain as little as possible beyond what is needed to write simple mathematics precisely. TLA+ is especially well suited for writing high-level specifications of concurrent and distributed systems.\n\nPlusCal is an algorithm language that, at first glance, looks like a typical tiny toy programming language. However, a PlusCal expression can be any TLA+ expression, which means anything that can be expressed with mathematics. This makes PlusCal much more expressive than any (real or toy) programming language. A PlusCal algorithm is translated into a TLA+ specification, to which the TLA+ tools can be applied.\n\nThe principal TLA+ tools are the TLC model checker and TLAPS, the TLA+ proof system. All the tools are normally used from the Toolbox, an IDE (integrated development environment). Go to the TLA home page to find out more about TLA.",

    "description": "**webpack is a module bundler**. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n## Overview\n\nCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM). \n\n## What makes webpack unique?\n\n**Extensibility** webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system. \n\n**Focused around Web Performance** webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\n\n**Built in JavaScript** webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve. \n\n**Used at Scale** webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\n\n**Community Owned** webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling",

An open-source bookmarking tool for great thinkers: the researchers, scientists, academics, students, polemics, publishers, reporters, and writers who want to make the world a better place using facts, research, and verified information.\n\nWith Memex  we want to help you ease the frustration of not being able to find something you’ve seen online, whether it’s a website, a post on social media, a useful comment, or important quote.\nUsers can find things again, by searching for every word of every website visited – plus they can filter by domain, custom tags or time.\nAlso users can create links to highlights of articles, they can send to other people.  \n\nMemex is built with full privacy and data ownership in mind. \nAll data is stored locally on a user’s own computer. You can also pause indexing, or to blacklist domains or URLs. \n\nOur long-term vision is to battle online misinformation, by enabling users to build on the past web-research of other people, and break out of their filter bubbles by comparing multiple different opinions.

We're asking bc unfortunately, we don't have the resources to help you learn basic programming skills in the languages/frameworks we use. Please give us a feel for the kind of projects you have been working on so far.\n4) Think equally carefully about what you want to learn in the next year, so we can help you achieve your learning goal during the summer and thereafter. \n5) For a successful application a (well) thought out plan on how to reach your project's goal is necessary.  6) #5 will require you already start hacking on some smaller things/preparations beforehand. Also it helps us getting a feel for how we work together :)\n\n### Next Steps\nStill interested? Great!\n\n1) Drop by in our Slack channel and say 'hi' in #intros. Include some trivia information about you and add the answers to the questions 3 & 4.\n2) Then we'll find a suitable test issue to work on for you\n3) Happy hacking :)",

Indeed, X.Org is much broader than just the X Window System. Under the umbrella of the X.Org Foundation can be found Linux's DRM subsystem (10% of the size of Linux), Mesa (open source 3D and video-decoding acceleration for AMD, Intel, NVIDIA,...), and Wayland. X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.\n\nToday, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.\n\nCome help us make the future more open!",

It should not be overly detailed just enough to understand the problem trying to be fixed and how this project opt to solve it.\n    How will I achieve this: Explain how the project will be done, what technologies are needed and how to implement them.\n    What will the project focus on: Explain what the project will focus on, what is the important parts of the project.\n    Benefits: Who will benefit and why from this project. Think about what a user or developer may need or do to benefit from it. Why does it benefit many users.\n    Goals: What is the goal of the project, a project may not always solve the problem entirely as it may take to much time. Think hard about what can be accomplished during a summer with your skill and deduct that quite a bit. If the project can't be done after this perhaps its better to opt for a smaller one or one with subgoals.\n    What does it touch in Kodi: Think about what parts of the code this may touch, Kodi is a big application and a lot of the code is spread out and very complex. If a project touches to much it may be impossible to complete.\n    Requirements: What is needed to complete the project, what code language knowledge what hardware etc.\n    Possible mentors: Place to add possible mentors (Team-Kodi will add this).",

    "description": "Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\n\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\n\nZulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.",
